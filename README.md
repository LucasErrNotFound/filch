Filch is a handy little tool created specifically for listening to and capturing information from clipboards, making it an excellent pick for anybody wishing to beef up their cyber security measures. Filch is a handy little tool created specifically for listening to and capturing information from clipboards, making it an excellent pick for anybody wishing to beef up their cyber security measures. Filch is an excellent tool to have in your armory, whether you are a seasoned security professional or just starting out. While the program has been created to be "sneaky," it should be highlighted that it is not intended to be used for malicious reasons.

As with any tool, Filch is not perfect, and there may be bugs and glitches that you encounter along the way. However, I am open to constructive criticism and feedback, and welcome any insights or suggestions you may have to offer. So if you have any thoughts or ideas on how I can improve this tool, please feel free to share them with me. Together, we can make Filch the best it can be!
