Filch is a nifty little tool that is designed for the specific purpose of listening to and grabbing information from clipboards, which makes it an ideal choice for anyone looking to bolster their cyber security measures. Whether you're a seasoned security professional or just starting out, Filch is a great tool to have in your arsenal. While the tool has been designed with the intention of being "sneaky," it should be noted that it is not actually meant to be used for nefarious purposes. Rather, it is intended to be used by individuals and organizations looking to enhance their own security practices.

As with any tool, Filch is not perfect, and there may be bugs and glitches that you encounter along the way. However, I am open to constructive criticism and feedback, and welcome any insights or suggestions you may have to offer. So if you have any thoughts or ideas on how I can improve this tool, please feel free to share them with me. Together, we can make Filch the best it can be!
